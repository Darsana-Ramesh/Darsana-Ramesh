## Hello world😁👋

I am **Darsana**, When I started engineering, I didn’t know exactly where it would take me — but one simple question changed everything: “What really happens when you click a button on a website?”
That moment sparked my curiosity, and soon I found myself diving into the world behind the screen.

Since then, I’ve been building — from basic web pages to full-stack applications — discovering the joy of creating digital experiences that are both functional and meaningful.


- 🌱 Right now, I’m diving into **AI, ML, React, Firebase, and Flask**. Each technology opens new doors and helps me craft applications that are smarter, faster, and more user-friendly.

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects that **combine logic and design** — whether it's a sleek front-end experience or a well-thought-out backend system. I'm always excited to learn from others and grow together.

- 🤔 I’m looking for help with integrating **AI-based features into web apps**.

- 💬 Ask me about **Python, Java, C, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Firebase, MySQL**, or anything related to building practical web apps. I’d love to share what I know and learn even more in the process.

- ⚡ Fun fact: Coding taught me patience… mostly thanks to missing `}` and forgotten `;` 😅
