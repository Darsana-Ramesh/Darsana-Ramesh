## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

When I took up engineering, I didnâ€™t know exactly where it would lead me â€” but I was always curious about how things work behind the scenes. It started with a simple question during a class project: *"What really happens when we click a button on a website?"*

That single thought sparked something deeper.

Iâ€™m **Darsana R**, and what began as a classroom curiosity has turned into a genuine passion for tech. Over time, I discovered the joy of not just using technology â€” but building it. From creating simple web pages to developing full-stack applications, I realized I love crafting digital experiences that are not only functional but meaningful.

Now, every line of code feels like a small step toward solving a real-world problem â€” and Iâ€™m excited to keep learning, building, and creating every day.

- ðŸŒ± Right now, Iâ€™m diving into **AI, ML, React, Firebase, and Flask**. Each technology opens new doors and helps me craft applications that are smarter, faster, and more user-friendly.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that **combine logic and design** â€” whether it's a sleek front-end experience or a well-thought-out backend system. I'm always excited to learn from others and grow together.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with integrating **AI-based features into web apps**.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about **Python, Java, C, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Firebase, MySQL**, or anything related to building practical web apps. Iâ€™d love to share what I know and learn even more in the process.
