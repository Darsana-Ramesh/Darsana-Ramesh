## Hello world😁👋

Hi, I’m Darsana! My journey in engineering began with a simple question: “What happens when you click a button on a website?” That curiosity led me into the world of web development — from basic pages to full-stack apps.

- Currently exploring AI, ML, React, Firebase, and Flask to build smarter, user-friendly applications.

- Open to collaborations that blend logic and design — front-end or back-end.
  
- Seeking guidance on adding AI features to web apps.
  
- Let’s chat about Python, Java, C, HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, Firebase, or MySQL — I love sharing and learning!

- How to reach me: You can connect with me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/darsanar/)

- Pronouns: *She/Her*

- Fun fact: Coding taught me patience… mostly thanks to missing `}` and forgotten `;` 😅

### 💡 The Engineer's Origin Story
My journey in engineering began not with a textbook, but with a simple, persistent question: ***“What is the magic that happens behind the scenes when I click this button?”***

That initial spark of curiosity quickly evolved into a drive to transform basic web pages into robust, full-stack applications. I thrive on blending complex logic with sleek, intuitive user experiences.

### 🚀 My Current Mission
I am focused on building smarter applications and expanding my expertise into the next generation of web development.

| Category | Focus Area | Goal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend** | `React`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `JS` | Crafting seamless user interfaces. |
| **Backend** | `Flask`, `Python`, `Java` | Architecting scalable server-side logic. |
| **Database** | `Firebase`, `MySQL` | Managing data efficiently and securely. |
| **Next Frontier** | 🧠 **AI & ML** | Integrating intelligence to enhance user experience. |

### ☕ A Little Fun Fact
```bash
# My commitment to clean code is high, but my commit messages 
# usually look like this:
$ git commit -m "Fixed missing } and forgotten ;"
