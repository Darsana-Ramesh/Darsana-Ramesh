## Hello world😁👋

Hi, I’m Darsana! My journey in engineering began with a simple question: “What happens when you click a button on a website?” That curiosity led me into the world of web development — from basic pages to full-stack apps.

- Currently exploring AI, ML, React, Firebase, and Flask to build smarter, user-friendly applications.

- Open to collaborations that blend logic and design — front-end or back-end.
  
- Seeking guidance on adding AI features to web apps.
  
- Let’s chat about Python, Java, C, HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, Firebase, or MySQL — I love sharing and learning!

- How to reach me: You can connect with me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/darsanar/)

- Pronouns: *She/Her*

- Fun fact: Coding taught me patience… mostly thanks to missing `}` and forgotten `;` 😅
